==================
=  Description:  =
==================
A program that creats a mosaic of a chosen image, from a stockpile of images
(=tiles , all same sized). the program takes sections(in tile size) from the
image, analayzes it, and finds best match from the tiles.(filtering first by
comparing the distance between average colour of the image and tile, and
later filters the smaller group by pixel-pixel compare to find best match).
 
(more about mosaic: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic").

Methods expeleind briefly:
# compare_pixel(pixel1, pixel2):
   determine the 'distance' between 2 given pixel, based on colour values
# compare(image1, image2):
   compare colors of 2 images, by pixel comparing
# get_piece(image, upper_left, size):
   returns an image: a section of the given image, of the given size,
   starting at the location : upper_left.
# set_piece(image, upper_left, piece):
   replaces the image's section starts at upper_left, in the image named piece
# average(image):
   returns the average color of the image's pixels divided by (red, green, blue)
# preprocess_tiles(tiles):
   returns a list of the average color values (tuple: (r, g, b)) of the given tiles
# get_best_tiles(objective, tiles, averages , num_candidates):
   returns a smaller list of tiles whom average values are closest to the objective's
# choose_tile(piece, tiles):
   the tile of the shortest distance to piece
# make_mosaic(image, tiles, num_candidates):
   returns  a mosaic of image made from tiles items
