==================
convert_spoon_to_cup.py:
	a simple method which convert the number of 
	spoons given as parameters to cups.
calculate_mathematical_expressions.py:
	Multiply, divide, subtract or add 2 given numbers,
	based on a given operator, as parameters or as string 
	of the form: 'num1, operator, num2'. order matters.
largest_to_smallest.py:
	a simple method which returns the maximal and minimal 
	number out of the 3 numbers given as a tuple: the number
	on left is the largest and the right one is the smallest.
quadratic_equation.py:
	calculates and return or print the solutions of a quadratic 
	equation which coefficients given as parameters or by user.
shapes.py:
	calculates and return the area of a chosen shape:
	circle, rectangular or trapezoid, based on user input.
bmi.py:
	a simple method which calculates one's bmi based 
	on height and weight values given as parameters. 
	returns true if the bmi value is in the range, false
