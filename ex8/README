==================
Running a battel ship game against computer.
the user can place a bomb on board by choosing a coordinate in board bounds.
the bomb stays on board 3 turns - or until it hits a ship
(checking wheter the bomb hit the ship is done after this turn ship's movement).
a ships which one of it's coordinates in hitten - stops sailing.
a ship is terminated when all of it's coordinates are hitten.
each turn report to user how many hits and termonations occures this turn.
the game ends when all ships are termonated.

	initialize, update inner status in case of an hit, ... ) 
2) a Direction Class:
	a class representing a valid direction for ships in battelship game
3)s Game Class:
