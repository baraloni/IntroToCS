================================
=  README for ex7: Recursion   =
================================
ex7.py - composed of several recursive methods

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
Contains several functions, that are using recursion. 
#print_to_n:
 prints all natural numbers in ascending order, from 1 to n.
#print_reversed_n:
 prints all natural numbers in descending order, from n to 1.
#has_divisor_smaller_than:
 checks if n has a divisor smaller or equal to i 
#is_prime:
 checks if n is prime.(returns true or false) uses has_divisor_smaller_than
#divisors_helper:
 divides n in all numbers from n to i (include), and append all complete
 dividers to the given list, ever changing it.
#divisors:
 creates a list of all dividers (between n to 1, including) of n,
 from smaller to greater. using the helper
#factorial:
 Calculates the value of the product of all ints starting from 1 to n.
#exp_n_x:
 calculates the exponential sum function of inserted values. using factorial
#play_hanoi:
 Solves Hanoi game.
#print_binary_sequences_with_prefix:
 prints all sequences in length n of '0','1', when given a string to work on.
#print_binary_sequences:
 prints all sequences in length n of '0','1'. using print_binary_sequences_with_prefix
#print_seq_helper:
 prints all combination of a seq with n characters, from the
 characters from char_lst when given a prefix seq
#print_sequences:
 prints all combination of a seq with n characters, from the
 characters from char_lst. using print_seq_helper
#no_rep_seq_helper:
 prints all combination of n characters, using the characters from
 char_list, when every character in seq appears exactly once.
 when given a blank seq to work on
#print_no_repetition_sequences:
 prints all combination of n characters, using the characters from
 char_list, when every character appears no more then once. uses the helper
#no_rep_seq_lst_helper:
 returns a list that contains all combination of n characters,
 using the characters from char_list, when every character appears
 no more then once, when given a blank seq to work on
#no_repetition_sequences_list:
 prints a list that contains all combination of n characters,
 using the characters from char_list, when every character appears
 no more then once. uses the helper: no_rep_seq_lst_helper
